    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> It is known that evaporation occurs in lakes and leads to direct water loss. In the science community, it is a goal to understand the rate of evaporation within lakes as well as how climate complicates the issue further. By understanding climatic conditions and the rate of evaporation, we can use many types of models like an eddy diffusion model to estimate the fluctuation in size of a particular lake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaporation in a lake occurs when “there is a vapor pressure between a lake surface and the overlying atmosphere and sufficient energy is available” (Hosteler and Bartlen 1990). The air must be saturated between the lake and surface boundary layer. The key to help determine evaporation is having an accurate estimate of lake surface temperature because saturation vapor pressure is a function of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where climatic conditions come into play regarding evaporation of a lake are the seasonal changes and how the strength of a winter or summer could change the thermal structure and evaporation of both shallow and deep lakes. Essentially, the lake surface temperature of shallow lakes can be estimated by a surface energy balance model where the net radiative forcing and air temperature of the lake are known. With deeper lakes, there can be an increase in evaporation due to “a significant amount of heat” being stored in the winter months and then released during the fall. Deeper lakes further complicate the calculation on how much the lake size fluctuates over some time scale (typically long). You need to account for the flux of heat into or out of the lake during seasonal cycles.\n",
